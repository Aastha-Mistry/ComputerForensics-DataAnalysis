# Cybercrime Data Analysis

This project showcases the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques in the field of computer forensics. Using the `cybercrime_forensic_dataset.csv` dataset from Kaggle, this project aims to detect suspicious activities and classify them using a RandomForestClassifier.

## Project Overview

In this project, I performed a detailed data analysis using Python, focusing on identifying patterns and anomalies in the dataset. The analysis was conducted using Jupyter Notebook, and various data visualization techniques were employed to understand the data better.

### Key Steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded and inspected the dataset.
   - Cleaned and handled missing data.
   - Engineered new features such as time-based attributes and IP frequency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized distributions of activity types, anomaly types, and labels.
   - Created a correlation heatmap to understand relationships between numerical features.

3. **Model Building and Evaluation**:
   - Utilized a RandomForestClassifier to classify the data into 'Normal' and 'Suspicious' labels.
   - Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Performed cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files in the Repository

- suspicious_data.csv: CSV file containing the processed suspicious data.

## Conclusion
This project highlights my skills in data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation in a forensic context. By leveraging machine learning, we can improve the detection of suspicious activities, enhancing the capabilities of digital forensics.
